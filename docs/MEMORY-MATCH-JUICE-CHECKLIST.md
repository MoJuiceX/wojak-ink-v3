# Memory Match Juice Implementation Checklist

> **Instructions for Claude CLI:** After implementing each enhancement from `MEMORY-MATCH-JUICE-IMPLEMENTATION.md`, mark it as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. Add brief implementation notes if needed.

---

## Phase 1: Sound Foundation

- [ ] **1. Mismatch sound** — Soft "thud" or disappointed tone when cards don't match
- [ ] **2. Streak-specific sounds** — Audio escalation (1=normal, 2=good, 3+=max)
- [ ] **3. Near-completion anticipation sound** — Tension builder when 1-2 pairs remain
- [ ] **4. Card hover sound** — Ultra-subtle feedback before click (debounced)
- [ ] **5. Fast match celebration sound** — Distinct sound for matches under 2.5s
- [ ] **6. Sound variations** — 3-4 variations per event type to prevent fatigue

---

## Phase 2: Haptic Layer

- [ ] **7. Card hover haptic** — Ultra-light 5ms tap on hover
- [ ] **8. Mismatch haptic** — Double-pulse error pattern (10ms-50ms-10ms)
- [ ] **9. Timer urgency haptic** — Pulse every second when timer ≤5s
- [ ] **10. Streak crescendo haptics** — Escalating pattern (1=single, 2=double, 3+=triple)

---

## Phase 3: Visual Polish

- [ ] **11. Squash and stretch on card flip** — Cards compress slightly on land
- [ ] **12. Matched card "pop" animation** — Scale 1→1.1→1 with bounce easing
- [ ] **13. Particle burst on match** — Confetti/sparkle particles from matched cards
- [ ] **14. Card "wobble" on mismatch** — Subtle shake before flip back
- [ ] **15. Progress bar celebration** — Timeline pulses/glows when pair matched
- [ ] **16. Near-win celebration** — Screen-wide shimmer when 1 pair left
- [ ] **17. Freeze frame on match** — 50-100ms pause for impact

---

## Phase 4: Anticipation & Flow

- [ ] **18. 2 pairs remaining glow** — Subtle glow on remaining unmatched cards
- [ ] **19. 1 pair remaining pulse + music** — Pulsing border, music intensity up
- [ ] **20. Timer critical shimmer** — Help shimmer when <10s and >3 pairs left
- [ ] **21. Variable shake intensity** — Streak 2=2px, streak 3+=4px
- [ ] **22. Shake decay** — Starts strong, fades over 200ms

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Personality

- [ ] **23. Theme-specific callouts** — Pull words from NFT metadata attributes
- [ ] **24. Contextual progress** — "5/12 - Keep Going!" with actual numbers
- [ ] **25. Dynamic music stems** — Base, urgency, intensity, victory layers
- [ ] **26. "Revenge" framing** — "You were 2 pairs away from Round 8!"
- [ ] **27. Share image generator** — Canvas-based winner image (right-click to save)
