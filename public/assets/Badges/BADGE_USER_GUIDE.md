# 🏅 Wojak Farmers Plot — Badge System

## What Are Badges?

Badges are special designations awarded to Wojaks that belong to one of 15 distinct **cultures** or **tribes** within the Wojak Farmers Plot collection. Think of them as clan membership — your Wojak isn't just a random farmer, it's part of something bigger.

**Only 1,438 out of 4,200 Wojaks (34.2%) have earned a badge.** If your Wojak has one, it's part of an exclusive group.

---

## Why Are Badges Valuable?

### 🎯 Identity & Belonging
Badges connect your Wojak to a specific culture with its own lore, aesthetic, and community. Royal Club members flex differently than Neckbeards — and both know it.

### 💎 Scarcity
Not every Wojak qualifies. Badges require specific trait combinations that only a fraction of the collection has. Some badges like **Namekian** (7 Wojaks) are ultra-rare.

### 🤝 Community
Badge holders share something in common. When you spot another Ronin or Honk Gang member, you're part of the same tribe.

### 📈 Provenance
Badges highlight Wojaks with intentional, thematic trait combinations — not random rolls. These combinations were curated to tell a story.

## How Do Wojaks Earn Badges?

Your Wojak earns a badge based on its traits. The system uses **Primary** and **Secondary** traits:

### The Rule
**1 PRIMARY trait + 1 SECONDARY trait = badge**

OR

**2 PRIMARY traits from the same badge = badge**

### Examples

🥷 **Ronin Badge**:
- Ronin Helmet (Primary) + Ronin Dojo (Secondary) = ✅ Badge
- Ronin Helmet (Primary) + Ronin Clothes (Primary) = ✅ Badge
- Ronin Helmet alone = ❌ No badge

👑 **Royal Club Badge** (Exception):
- Crown or Tiara alone = ✅ Badge (no secondary needed)

💚 **Namekian Badge** (Exception):
- Must have BOTH Piccolo Turban AND Piccolo Uniform = ✅ Badge

## Check Your Wojak

Look at your Wojak's traits:
1. Does it have a **Primary** trait from any badge?
2. Does it have a matching **Secondary** trait?
3. OR does it have **2 Primary** traits from the same badge?

If yes, your Wojak has earned its badge. Wear it proud. 🏅

*Badges don't change rarity scores — they highlight cultural belonging. A common Wojak with a badge is part of something. That matters.*
