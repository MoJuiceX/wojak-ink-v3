## HEAD TRAITS (14)

### Crown (140 exist)
**Creator:** Bullish0x
**Why HP:** Bullish0x convinced the entire Tang Gang community that Crown is the most valuable trait in the collection. It wasn't luck—it was a masterclass in social engineering. Royal Club members don't sell; they set unreasonable prices and wait.

### Piccolo Turban (9 exist)
**Creator:** MoJuice
**Why HP:** The rarest head trait in the collection, and it can ONLY appear on Alien Wojak bases. This is the Green Connection: Chia is green, Piccolo is green, money is green. Namekian royalty for those who understand the DBZ reference.

### Tiara (24 exist)
**Creator:** Bullish0x
**Why HP:** Crown's sister trait, created specifically for the queens of Tang Gang. Bullish0x didn't forget that royalty comes in all forms. If Crown is king energy, Tiara is queen energy.

### Headphones (13 exist)
**Creator:** MoJuice
**Why HP:** The rarest head trait by count, and 69% of them landed on Monkey Zoo bases. This honors Monkeyzoo, the educator who teaches Tang Gang in the Twitter Spaces. The apes are always listening.

### Military Beret (164 exist)
**Creator:** TheStakerClass
**Why HP:** TheStakerClass founded ChiaPhunks—the OG Chia NFT collection. The beret is his signature, and ChiaPhunks face left. "The beret stays on" isn't a suggestion; it's identity.

### Fedora (114 exist)
**Creator:** DegenWaffle
**Why HP:** DegenWaffle created Neckbeard Punks, the cyberpunk gambling degens of Tang Gang. The Fedora is part of the Classic Neckbeard loadout. "The blade has been studied" is the motto of those who've done the research.

### Wizard Hat (248 exist)
**Creator:** High Council
**Why HP:** The High Council of Wizards is a Tang Gang community that takes magic seriously. "Whiz nerds" don't explain their methods—it just works. Pizza, pizza, pizza.

### Ronin Helmet (130 exist)
**Creator:** OrangeGooey
**Why HP:** OrangeGooey created the Ronin collection—masterless samurai who answer to no one. "Accept cookies" is his signature phrase, delivered with tough love and zero sugarcoating.

### Pirate Hat (100 exist)
**Creator:** MoJuice
**Why HP:** Pirates don't ask permission. They take what they can and give nothing back. Full Pirate loadout requires Eye Patch, but the hat alone carries the energy.

### Clown (143 exist)
**Creator:** ChiaPhunks tribute
**Why HP:** They called us clowns for buying JPEGs on a blockchain nobody heard of. We called it alpha. This trait honors ChiaPhunks and everyone who got laughed at before they got rich.

**Why HP:** Political meme culture immortalized on-chain. "Make bags great again" transcends politics—it's about conviction in your portfolio.

### Spikes (100 exist)
**Creator:** MoJuice
**Why HP:** Punk rock energy for the rebels of Tang Gang. Not everyone fits the mold, and Spikes wearers don't try to.

### Bepe Suit (56 exist)
**Creator:** Tom Bepe
**Why HP:** Tom Bepe organized the $BEPE movement, the most liquid memecoin on Chia. "Orange is greater than green" is the battle cry. $BEPE will be on Coinbase before any other Chia memecoin—mark it.

### Straitjacket (100 exist)
**Creator:** MoJuice
**Why HP:** Part of the Asylum Patient combo. The market tried to break you with rugs, FUD, and panic sells. It failed. Now the straitjacket is a badge of honor. Too degen for therapy.
