## LEGENDARY COMBOS (Rarest)

### 🟢 Namekian Royalty
**Requirements:** Piccolo Turban + Piccolo Uniform  
**Why Special:** The rarest named combo in the entire collection. Only 7 exist. Piccolo Turban can ONLY appear on Alien Wojak bases, making this the ultimate DBZ tribute. When Piccolo removes the weighted training gear, game over. Green Connection royalty.

### 👑 Royal Neckbeard
**Requirements:** Crown + Neckbeard  
**Why Special:** Two Tang Gang titans collide. Bullish0x's Crown psyop meets DegenWaffle's "Winners Win" philosophy. This combo proves you can be royalty AND a degen. The king who never shaves, never sells.

### 👑 Royal MOG
**Requirements:** Crown + MOG Glasses  
**Why Special:** Royalty that mogs. When Crown meets MOG Glasses, the conversation isn't just over—it was never allowed to start. Peak flex energy. You outrank them AND you've mogged them.

## SIGNATURE COMBOS (Creator Tributes)

### 🎩 Classic Neckbeard
**Requirements:** Fedora + Neckbeard  
**Why Special:** DegenWaffle's original signature loadout. The Fedora tips, the Neckbeard grows, the blade has been studied. This is Neckbeard Punks in its purest form. Cyberpunk gambling degen royalty.

### 🎖️ Tang Gang Commander
**Requirements:** El Presidente + Military Beret  
**Why Special:** TheStakerClass tribute combo. El Presidente was created specifically for him, and the Military Beret is his ChiaPhunks signature. Not elected—appointed. The beret stays on, the command is absolute.

### ⚔️ Full Ronin
**Requirements:** Any 2 of: Ronin Helmet, Ronin clothes, Ronin Dojo background  
**Why Special:** OrangeGooey's legacy combo. Masterless samurai who answer to no one. "Accept cookies" is delivered with tough love. Ronin walk alone but walk strong. Discipline over chaos.

### 🧙 High Council
**Requirements:** Any 2 of: Wizard Hat, Wizard Drip, Wizard Glasses, Spell Room background  
**Why Special:** The High Council of Wizards is Tang Gang's magic community. Whiz nerds don't explain their methods—it just works. Pizza, pizza, pizza. Two wizard pieces grant you council membership.

### 🍊 Full Bepe
**Requirements:** Bepe Suit + Bepe base (Wojak/Soyjak/Waifu/Baddie)  
**Why Special:** Tom Bepe's true believers. Wearing the Bepe Suit on a Bepe base means you're all-in on orange. $BEPE is the most liquid memecoin on Chia. Orange is greater than green—and you're living proof.

## MILITARY COMBOS (Loadouts)

### 🪖 Bepe Army
**Requirements:** Any 2 of: Bepe Army clothes, Field Cap, Hard Hat, Bepe Barracks background  
**Why Special:** Tom Bepe's infantry division. The army marches in orange, not green. Field Cap or Hard Hat shows rank, Bepe Barracks is home base. Two pieces and you're enlisted. The army grows with every convert.

### 🛡️ Full SWAT
**Requirements:** SWAT Helmet + SWAT Gear  
**Why Special:** Tactical precision loadout. "Breach and clear" isn't a suggestion—it's the only approach. Find the alpha, execute the plan, don't hesitate. Full tactical gear for those who move with purpose.

### 🔥 Full Firefighter
**Requirements:** Firefighter Helmet + Firefighter Uniform  
**Why Special:** "Buy the fire" mentality. While others panic when the market burns, firefighters run toward it. Full gear means you're equipped to handle the heat. Red candles don't scare you.

### ⚔️ Full Viking
**Requirements:** Viking Helmet + Viking Armor  
**Why Special:** Raiders don't ask permission. Vikings conquered, took what they wanted, and built legends. In crypto, same energy. Valhalla awaits those with diamond hands. Full armor means full commitment.

### 🏛️ Full Roman
**Requirements:** Centurion + Roman Drip  
**Why Special:** The Roman Empire is a meme, but the grind is real. Centurion helmet plus Roman Drip means you're in the trenches and looking good doing it. The empire didn't fall—it moved to crypto.

## CHARACTER COMBOS (Full Transformations)

### 🧛 Full Vampire
**Requirements:** Drac + Vampire Teeth  
**Why Special:** Dracattus tribute complete. The vampire dev ships at dawn while others sleep. Full vampire loadout means you hunt when the market is quiet. The thirst is real—for alpha, for gains, for victory. Bloodline secured.

### ⚡ Full Super Saiyan
**Requirements:** Super Saiyan + Super Saiyan Uniform  
**Why Special:** DBZ transformation complete. When your portfolio dips, you don't panic—you power up. "This isn't even my final form" energy. Full Super Saiyan means your power level is over 9000.

### 🤡 Full Clown
**Requirements:** Clown + Clown Nose  
**Why Special:** ChiaPhunks tribute complete. They called us clowns for buying JPEGs on Chia. We called it alpha. Full clown loadout means you embraced the joke and got the last laugh. Honk honk.

### 🏴‍☠️ Full Pirate
**Requirements:** Pirate Hat + Eye Patch  
**Why Special:** "Take what you can, give nothing back." Pirates don't ask permission, don't follow rules, and don't apologize. The eye patch isn't a wound—it's a badge of battles survived.

### 🐢 Full Ninja Turtle
**Requirements:** Ninja Turtle Mask + Ninja Turtle Fit  
**Why Special:** Cowabunga! Heroes in a half shell, turtle power. Full Ninja Turtle loadout is pure 90s nostalgia for the degens who grew up on pizza and cartoons. Shell yeah.

### 😷 Asylum Patient
**Requirements:** Straitjacket + Hannibal Mask  
**Why Special:** "Silence of the degens." The market tried to break you with rugs, FUD, and liquidations. It failed. Now you wear the straitjacket as a badge of honor. Too far gone, too degen for therapy—and proud of it.

## DIVINE COMBOS (Spiritual)

### 😇 Divine Loadout
**Requirements:** Halo + God's Robe  
**Why Special:** Ascended beyond mortal degen status. Survived the rugs, the panic sells, the 90% drawdowns. Diamond hands so strong they're divine. Blessed gains only. Higher plane portfolio management.

### 😇 Angel in Heaven
**Requirements:** Halo + Heaven background  
**Why Special:** Found your final resting place—and it's bullish. Angel in Heaven means you've ascended to where the gains are eternal. No more earthly FUD can touch you.

### 😈 Devil in Hell
**Requirements:** Devil Horns + Hell background  
**Why Special:** Sold your soul to the blockchain at 3am and you'd do it again. Devil in Hell means you've found your natural habitat. Chaos agent energy. The fire doesn't burn you—it fuels you.

## LOCATION COMBOS (Trait + Background)

### 🚀 Lunar Landing
**Requirements:** Astronaut + Moon background  
**Why Special:** "To the moon" isn't just a meme—it's a destination. And you've already arrived. Astronaut on Moon means the mission is complete. While others are still hoping, you've already landed.

### 🌾 Plot Secured
**Requirements:** Chia Farmer + Chia Farm background  
**Why Special:** THE Chia combo. Farmer drip plus the farm itself. "Farmed, not FOMO'd" is the Chia way. While others panic-bought, you plotted in silence. The plot is secured, the farm is operational.

## SINGLE TRAIT BADGES

### 🪿 Honk Gang
**Requirements:** Goose Suit (no combo needed)  
**Why Special:** Honors Foods, the Goose of Tang Gang. Gene Hoffman promised to honk on Joe Rogan's podcast—this is Tang Gang canon. "Peace was never an option." Wearing the Goose Suit alone is enough to join the flock.
