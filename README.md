## About the Collection

**Wojak Farmers Plot** is a collection of 4,200 NFTs on the Chia blockchain. Each Wojak is a unique combination of hand-drawn layers created by the artist, featuring various bases (Wojak, Soyjak, Waifu, Baddie, and rare variants like Alien, Bepe, Monkey Zoo, and Papa Tang) combined with accessories, backgrounds, and special attributes.

The collection has developed its own culture around "provenance" - certain attributes like Crown, Military Beret, Fedora, and Wizard Hat have become highly valued by the community regardless of statistical rarity.
